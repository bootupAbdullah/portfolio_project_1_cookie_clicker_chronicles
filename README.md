### In this game, elves are developing a revolutionary cookie dough called "SantaSynth," designed to interact with Santa's unique genetics. This cookie dough magically disappears when eaten, providing all the joy of snacking without any calories or unhealthy side effects. Players click on cookies to 'eat' them, helping the elves test and perfect SantaSynth. Once enough cookies are consumed, confirming the dough's safety, the elves plan to replace the world's cookie supply. This ensures that when Santa eats cookies made from this dough, they won't affect his health.
