### The following lines of code were discovered by trouble shooting, asking for advice from ChatGPT: 
###    JS:
### - 'audio.play()'
### - 'audio.pause()'
###
###    CSS:
### -  'text-shadow: 0 0 10px #FFD700, 0 0 20px #FFD700;'
### -  'box-shadow: 0 5px #70615f ;'
### -  'transform: translateY(3px);'
### With CSS in particular, I learned how to create clickable button effects, which I initially struggled to remember. Additionally, I heavily relied on ChatGPT to overcome challenges with media queries, benefiting greatly from the ability to interact and clarify concepts through discussion.

## Other than this, as far as I am aware, I wrote every line of code in this game.

### In this game, elves are developing a revolutionary cookie dough called "SantaSynth," designed to interact with Santa's unique genetics. This cookie dough magically disappears when eaten, providing all the joy of snacking without any calories or unhealthy side effects. Players click on cookies to 'eat' them, helping the elves test and perfect SantaSynth. Once enough cookies are consumed, confirming the dough's safety, the elves plan to replace the world's cookie supply. This ensures that when Santa eats cookies made from this dough, they won't affect his health.
